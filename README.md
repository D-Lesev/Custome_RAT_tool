# Custome_RAT_tool
A tool, which is used for remote access to computer

We have 2 files - main_server.py and main_target.py
Main_server acts as s Listener while Main_target will be the backdoor

We can a lot of default commands, while we have few custom made commands:
  - Upload file
  - Download file
  - Changeding the path
 
 Before compile the backdoor to exe file, changing the IP/Port are required.
 
 We also implemented a function which makes our backdoor running always with Windows booting.
